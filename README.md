TODO:
* Allow user to select which sub-zone they wish to subscribe to (for example, Yellowstone National Park has 3 zones). Currently it just grabs the first one it finds in the DBX file.
* Allow partial matches for counties (i.e. Southern Cook/North Shore would match for 'Southern Cook' or 'North Shore'). Currently the user must know the exact string in the DBX file.
